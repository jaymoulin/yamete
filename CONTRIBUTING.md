How to Contribute

This project welcomes your contribution. There are several ways to help out:

if you have found a bug or have an idea for a feature
* Write test cases for open bug issues
* Write patches for open bug/feature issues

* The code must follow the [PSR-2 coding standard](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/).
* All code changes should be covered by unit tests

Coding Standard
---------------

Make sure your code changes comply with the PSR-2 coding standard by
